Hello! I am an ML Researcher & Applied Scientist.
I am currently working at [**Nike**](https://jobs.nike.com/fr/insights-and-analytics) in the Search team, in charge of Matching, Ranking and GenAI initiatives for both Nike APP and Nike.com. Before that, I was a Research Scientist in the Cognitive Computing Lab at [**Baidu Research**](http://research.baidu.com/) working with Dr. Ping Li.
